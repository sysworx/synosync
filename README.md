# synosync opensource
synoSync is a small tool that decrypts DLC files and pushes them on the Synology NAS to the pre-installed Synology Download Station. In addition synoSync supports the Click’n’Load protocol.

synoSync supports any Synology Disk Station from DSM 5.x (it could also work with 4.x, but this is not tested or supported by us).

The tool was developed (with Xojo) and tested on Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite. Since 08.03.2016 synosync is now under GNU LGPL. I dont have a mac anymore for a long time, so i cant maintain the tool anymore, so i give it opensource.

The Tool uses two Xojo commercial pugins:

- MBS Cocoa (https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/xojo/plugin-cocoa.shtml)
- MBS Encryption (https://www.monkeybreadsoftware.net/plugins-mbsencryptionplugin.shtml)
 
These two plugins were needed to run and compile the tool.

Keep in mind, this was my first xojo app, so there can be code issues or unclean routines...feel free to correct them.
